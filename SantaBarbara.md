## Why I like Santa Barbara 
Santa Barbara played a huge part of my life because this is the first time that I have ever had to do things on my own because I have never moved away like this before.
Moving here made me become a better person and I couldnt be more thankful for all the things it provided for me and great opportunities I had there.
### About Santa Barbara
Santa Barbara is a city on the central California coast, with the Santa Ynez Mountains as dramatic backdrop. Downtown, Mediterranean-style white stucco buildings with red-tile roofs reflect the cityâ€™s Spanish colonial heritage. Upscale boutiques and restaurants offering local wines and seasonal fare line State Street. On a nearby hill, Mission Santa Barbara, founded in 1786, houses Franciscan friars and a museum.
