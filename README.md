## Kason Carter

My name is Kason Carter. I played baseball at [Santa Barbara City College](https://www.sbcc.edu) last year and had an injury that would have put me out of the game for a while so I decided to transfer to the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu) and now I am studying computer science. Santa Barbara was a wonderful place to live and go to school. For more information on click the link below.

I am a only child.  My moms name is Kelly, and my Fathers name is Kenny.
I have joined Delta Upislon and started to play golf since I have got to Mizzou.
