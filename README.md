# Kason Carter

My name is **Kason Carter**. I played baseball at [Santa Barbara City College](https://www.sbcc.edu) last year and had an injury that would have put me out of the game for a while so I decided to transfer to the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu) and now I am studying [computer science](codeexample.md). Santa Barbara was a wonderful place to live and go to school. For more information on Santa Barbara, [click here.](https://github.com/KSC7G5/Final/blob/master/SantaBarbara.md)

I am a only child from Lee's Summit, MO.  My mom's name is Kelly, and my dad's name is Kenny.  My dad works for [UMB Bank](https://umb.com). 

I  joined [Delta Upislon](Frat.md) here at MU and have made many life-long friends.
