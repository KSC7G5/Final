## Kason Carter

My name is Kason Carter. I played baseball at [Santa Barbara City College](https://www.sbcc.edu) last year and had an injury that would have put me out of the game for a while so I decided to transfer to the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu) and now I am studying computer science. Santa Barbara was a wonderful place to live and go to school. For more information on Santa Barbara, [click here.](SantaBarbara.md)

I am a only child.  My mom's name is Kelly, and my dad's name is Kenny.  My dad works for [UMB Bank](www.umb.com).

I have joined [Delta Upislon](frat.md) and started to play golf since I have got to Mizzou.
