## Favorite Food
My favorite food is chinese food. I love chinese food so much and would love to share my favorite chineses places in the Kansas City area.
### *Pf Changs* 
* If you ever find yourself next to a Pf Changs you better take andvantage of it becasue it is by far the best food in the world.

### *Bo Lings*
* Bo Lings has some of the best chicken fried rice that I have ever had and it is pretty cheap for the amount of food you get.  This place is definetly worth going to when you are starving.

### *Shang Hy-Boy*
* This Lee's Summit hole in the wall, not only had great General's Chicken, but also a great cheeseburger.
